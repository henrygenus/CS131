STRUCTURE:
    Server Class
        dictionary of messages for clients
        list for communicable servers with connection status
        various server details
        Message Class
                WHATSAT -- from client, respond with Google Places
                        if receive WHATSAT, send request to Google Places, then give JSON
                IMAT -- from client, respond with AT message
                        if receive IMAT, send AT to connected servers, client
                AT -- for reporting location to another server; this is what is stored
                        if receive AT, forward to all connected servers except sender

WHATSAT -- Google Nearby Search
        Format: https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/nearbysearch/json?parameters
                where parameters = {key, location, radius}

This project utilizes an additional file called "constants.py".  It contains a private API key and is thus left out of the repository.  The other constants defined are:

URL = "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/nearbysearch/json"
MAX_LEN = int(1e5)
connections = {
	<SERVERNAME>:[CONNECTED SERVER NAMES LIST],
	<SERVERNAME>:[CONNECTED SERVER NAMES LIST],
	...
}

DEBUG = False # true if messages passed are to be sent to stdio as well.

SCOPE = "LOCAL" #"LOCAL" uses the below local port map, "REMOTE" uses the remote.

# these ports work on my machine and the SEASNET servers, respectively.
# names are arbitrary and must only match the above connections.
