Flooding: (@ en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flooding_%28computer_networking%29)
There are several variants of flooding algorithms. Most work roughly as follows:
    Each node acts as both a transmitter and a receiver.
    Each node tries to forward every message to every one of its neighbors except the source node.
This results in every message eventually being delivered to all reachable parts of the network.
Precautions have to be taken to avoid wasted duplicate deliveries and infinite loops, and to allow
messages to eventually expire from the system.
----- Selective flooding -----
A variant of flooding called selective flooding partially addresses these issues by only sending
packets to routers in the same direction. In selective flooding the routers don't send every
incoming packet on every line but only on those lines which are going approximately in the right direction.
